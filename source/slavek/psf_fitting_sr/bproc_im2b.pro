;
; simulation of an observation, assume the test "object" sampled 8x better
;    than the "observed" one
; 
; takes the theoretical test image obj (256 pix) and 
;     1. shifts by sh big (32) pixels (sh>0, right), Gaussian distributed (disp=s1)
;     2. adds Gauss noise with disp=s2 std error per small pixel (256)
;            now noise only where the image is present, not in the sky 
;
; use: obs = BProc_im2(obj,4.0,0.01, sh)  
;            for disp~=size of image (8 big, 64 small pix)
